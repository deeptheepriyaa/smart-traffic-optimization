# Smart IoT-Based Traffic Flow Optimization

## Overview
This project focuses on optimizing traffic flow using Internet of Things (IoT) technology and machine learning. The system collects real-time traffic data, processes it, and predicts traffic flow to improve urban mobility and reduce congestion.

### Key Features:
- Real-time traffic data collection using IoT sensors.
- Machine learning models to predict traffic flow and optimize signal timings.
- Traffic flow optimization through intelligent traffic light control.
- Integration with a Flask-based web API for model predictions.
